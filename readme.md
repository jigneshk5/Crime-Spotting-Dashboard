# Solution of Use case 3 :

I have prepared these dashboards as mentioned in the use case of Cognizant Azure Hackathon. I have also attached the links to the dashboard apart from attaching the 
original .pbix file. Since I build different dashboard on different pages So here are the dashboards with the their corresponding pages:

- Dashboard 1(Crime Spotting Dashboard with Dropdowns,maps,Piechart and Waffle chart) => page 2
- Dashboard 2(Region wise Crime Spotting Dashboard) => page 3
- Dashboard 3(Crime count wise Crime Spotting Dashboard) => page 1
- Dashboard 4(Dashboard to show the crime spot region wise) => page 4

## Data Used:

I have used data from "https://data.police.uk/data/". For these dashboards, I have used one month crime data of April 2019 of three cities of UK which are:
1. Cumbria Street
2. Warwickshire Street
3. Wiltshire Street
These data is also attached in the crime_data in root of the project directory. 
Note:- I have used enough data to fullfill all the requirements of the use case.
